# 🧠 Dart CLI Quiz App

Welcome to my Week 1 mini project for the **Dart Programming Bootcamp**! This CLI-based quiz app is built using Dart and showcases foundational concepts like variables, data types, functions, control flow, and basic logic building.

## 📚 Project Overview

This app presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user, tracks their score, and displays the final result. It’s designed to run in a Dart CLI environment or directly on [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev).

### ✅ Features

- 5+ multiple-choice questions
- Score tracking
- Modular code using functions
- Questions and answers stored in Lists and Maps
- Control flow using `if/else`, `for`, and `while` loops
- Final score output with feedback

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Dart (CLI or DartPad)
- Dart built-in types: `int`, `String`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`
- Functions and control flow statements

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run the app in two ways:

### Option 1: DartPad

1. Visit [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev)
2. Paste the code into the editor
3. Click **Run**

### Option 2: Local Dart Environment

1. Make sure Dart SDK is installed
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dart-quiz-app.git
   cd dart-quiz-app
   dart run quiz.dart

🎯 Learning Goals
This project helped me reinforce:
- Dart syntax and structure
- Using collections like Lists and Maps
- Writing clean, modular functions
- Implementing control flow for interactive logic
